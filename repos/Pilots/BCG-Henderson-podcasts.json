Previously he worked in the British Government as a policy adviser in the Prime Minister\u2019s Strategy Unit, as a policy analyst in the Policy Unit in 10 Downing Street, and as a senior policy adviser in the Cabinet Office. In A World Without Work Susskind argues that technology will lead to structural technological unemployment sooner than many economists believe. This will pose a societal distribution challenge as labor markets will be a less effective way of distributing society\u2019s income. The book makes concrete policy proposals to confront inequality and other challenges resulting from technology\u2019s impact. In a conversation with Philipp Carlsson-Szlezak, BCG Chief Economist, Susskind discusses the drivers of technological unemployment, monopoly power, universal basic income, the future role of the state, as well as the personal implications for future generations. *** About the BCG Henderson Institute The BCG Henderson Institute is the Boston Consulting Group\u2019s think tank, dedicated to exploring and developing valuable new insights from business, technology, economics, and science by embracing the powerful technology of ideas.

        "episode_description": "Spoiler Alert We preface this podcast with a \u2018spoiler alert\u2019 as this novel is different from the more formal economics works we usually discuss on this podcast, and we wish to give the listener the chance to opt-out and read the book first if they wish. We greatly enjoyed the read and even if we don\u2019t see eye to eye on much of the economics in this novel, we found the indulgence of literature a valuable endeavor to make more tangible some of the human aspects of economics\u200a\u2014\u200aincluding the fear of collapse. *** Lionel Shriver is the author of several prize-winning novels including the best-seller We Need To Talk About Kevin (2003) and A Perfectly Good Family (1996). Her novels typically tackle difficult societal problems. She is also a contributing journalist to publications such as The Economist and The New York Times. She joins BCG Chief Economist Philipp Carlsson-Szlezak in conversation to discuss her book, The Mandibles: A Family, 2029\u20132047, a riveting and dystopian take on the destructive potential of national debt, currency crisis, and inflation as experienced by one fictional family across several generations and socio-economic circumstances. They discuss the novel, why economic dystopian novels are rare, and the way in which the novel can make the fears of economic collapse come alive.  *** About the BCG Henderson Institute The BCG Henderson Institute is the Boston Consulting Group\u2019s think tank, dedicated to exploring and developing valuable new insights from business, technology, economics, and science by embracing the powerful technology of ideas.

Their new book, Business Model Innovation Strategy: Transformational Concepts and Tools for Entrepreneurial Leaders, is a guide on business model design for leaders. In a conversation with Martin Reeves, Chairman of the BCG Henderson Institute the authors argue that business model innovation does not replace traditional strategy, but instead complements it by providing new opportunities to disrupt the market or reinvigorate an established firm, by creating an advantaged system of activities. *** About the BCG Henderson Institute The BCG Henderson Institute is the Boston Consulting Group\u2019s think tank, dedicated to exploring and developing valuable new insights from business, technology, economics, and science by embracing the powerful technology of ideas.

        "episode_description": "Luciano Pietronero is an Italian statistical physics and full professor at the department of physics at University of Rome Sapienza. He was the founder and director of the Institute of Complex Systems of CNR from 2004 to 2014. Luciano\u2019s research activities have been on fundamental and applied problems in the areas of condensed matter theory, statistical physics, and complex systems. His most recent focus is on economic complexity. He is the author of about 400 papers in leading scientific journals, and he has been awarded the Enrico Fermi Prize, highest award of the Italian Physical Society, in 2008. In a conversation with Philipp Carlsson-Szlezak, BCG Chief Economist, Professor Pietronero discusses using the tools of physics to forecast long-term economic growth, the value and limitations of imposing the rigor of natural science on economics, and why he thinks that the study of nations\u2019 \u201ceconomic complexity\u201d, a quantification of comparative advantage, is a better predictor of long-term economic growth than existing methods. *** About the BCG Henderson Institute The BCG Henderson Institute is the Boston Consulting Group\u2019s think tank, dedicated to exploring and developing valuable new insights from business, technology, economics, and science by embracing the powerful technology of ideas.

            "0:00:16.400000": "I'm joined by Luciano pewter narrow professor of condensed matter physics at the University of Rome and director of the Enrico Fermi Research Center in Italy interesting ly Professor Pietra.",
            "0:00:28.300000": "Niro has also been turned into the field of economics and long-term growth forecasting of economies bringing some of his physics tools to address with the tricky Topic in economics.",
            "0:00:38.900000": "The intersection of his physics and Economics work is the focus of our conversation today, and I thank you very much for joining me today Professor.",
            "0:00:46.600000": "Thank you very much.",
            "0:00:48.300000": "It's a great pleasure for me.",
            "0:00:52": "Let's start with your work on economic complexity and economic Fitness the way you define economic complexity.",
            "0:00:58.700000": "I think is you look at the output of production base of economies.",
            "0:01:02.500000": "And you look at the sophistication of that out there in a few sentences.",
            "0:01:05.200000": "Could you explain to our listeners the concept and how I help forecasting growth of the economy's?",
            "0:01:13.600000": "Yes, we look at data first.",
            "0:01:16": "So this is where look at the reality as in science.",
            "0:01:19": "Then release you get an intuition intuition.",
            "0:01:22.100000": "You can stop the story and then you check the store.",
            "0:01:25.700000": "So this is the process which days are will we look at the data of who produces what they mean you have cancer has and products and you see that the most sophisticated can't they don't know he was just an iPhone lose everything from the very simple to the most sophisticated triangular Matrix is a key element for Progress.",
            "0:01:52.100000": "This is the observation the intuition is okay diversification is fine.",
            "0:01:57.800000": "But if you make you know this little while or if you make the iPhone, I mean this cannot count exactly the same so we made the pacification waited by the complexity of the products.",
            "0:02:11.800000": "So this is the formula Let's take a country example to make those very tangible.",
            "0:02:18": "So I noticed and some of your approach you mentioned the bric economies the Brazil Russia India China, which were once lumped together as a homogeneous group with great growth prospects.",
            "0:02:30": "And of course, it doesn't turn out like that just look at the dead versions of China and Brazil and you say that economic complexity would have predicted that Divergence even 10 years ago or sooner now taking Brazil.",
            "0:02:41.700000": "However, so if you take a classic interpretation of Brazil's under-performance over the last 15-20 years, you would stress and emphasized for example, the quality of Institutions the challenges and political economy indeed the corruption Scandal that has engulfed nachos politics, but the economy's is all of these are qualitative measures that ring very true.",
            "0:03:05.400000": "How does economic complexity capture that it is it maybe even a proxy for those qualitative under?",
            "0:03:13.500000": "This is very link to the story of selecting data and reducing them.",
            "0:03:19.400000": "So they philosophy is that if you take the proxy of your capabilities as the product you are able to make Plasma Services actually a better jokes you ever have time for this we cannot do because this is nothing more genius measure.",
            "0:03:35.700000": "I just think the problem is that if you are able to make yourself behind this capability that is the financial system because it doesn't work in the street doesn't make the product is that all this stuff for that?",
            "0:03:57.200000": "You'll be mine production capability of the government to honesty is somehow summarized by what you do.",
            "0:04:05.700000": "This is if it was Data without arbitrary action is that what we want is to have something that if you liberal use it it is the same result and we can test it scientifically.",
            "0:04:30.600000": "So this is a real difference with most of them.",
            "0:04:33.800000": "So the standard approach of the international monetary fund is to have one pimple country with an approach which is to know which country didn't forget it.",
            "0:04:50": "Now, if you want to test these ourselves and do it yourself, it is impossible impossible in our case.",
            "0:04:57.400000": "We have you want to test it masturbation is student.",
            "0:05:02.800000": "What about 2:30 and you get the same results as we get.",
            "0:05:06.700000": "Okay. So this is it for us at Paramount TV show Distance yourself you got to believe you said you've been tested with BAC tester about to go through saying economic complexity picks up.",
            "0:05:22.400000": "The underlying institutional Dimension is a proxy for those drivers as well.",
            "0:05:26.800000": "And so this is how you square that okay.",
            "0:05:31": "Let's of comparative advantage which has a long history and economics thought is it fair to Describe economic complexity and economic Fitness as a measure of the breadth of comparative advantage.",
            "0:05:43.800000": "So another words that sounds like those that have breath in comparative advantage but have low incomes today.",
            "0:05:50.900000": "They have a clear path to catch-up growth, but those that don't have comparative advantage today and low incomes their path is closed.",
            "0:05:59.800000": "And if that is true, is that a gloomy message really for those who haven't yet succeeded in building the complexity that you measure to what we think Yes, I think this is a fair description roughly speaking.",
            "0:06:17.500000": "But let me be a little more precise about comparative advantage example, some people think that is somewhat colonialist.",
            "0:06:28": "For example, if you ask discuss with chili that you say, okay.",
            "0:06:32.800000": "She let you stay with the simple brother because we are competitive advantage and we saw some people sink in discharge.",
            "0:06:45.100000": "That's not what you what you say that I agree, but I don't agree on some interpretations that are given to competitive advantage.",
            "0:06:53.700000": "Let's talk about developing countries vs.",
            "0:06:57.600000": "Advanced economies and the predictive capabilities off your model.",
            "0:07:02": "So I think it's very intuitive what you say when economic complexity is low.",
            "0:07:07.200000": "There is ketchup gross and the model captures.",
            "0:07:10.900000": "Quantitatively it's less clear to me how the predictive capabilities of the model Ward four economies that already advanced particularly because your methodology appears to be a relative wind.",
            "0:07:22.700000": "So catching up is relative to the most advanced economies.",
            "0:07:26": "And so it almost seems difficult to capture the highs for those that are already there a band or is it even the case that the fact that others are catching up with the most advanced ones in a relative sense actually pushes down the most advanced ones.",
            "0:07:41.300000": "How do you think about it?",
            "0:07:42.400000": "Basically, this is a really challenging good question.",
            "0:07:45.800000": "So, I mean, I have a different answer for that start with the easy ones when we look at this photo of into dementia.",
            "0:07:53.700000": "You see that the right side that comes with Trevor to my wife fitness and relatively low GDP per capita.",
            "0:08:01": "That is where your for the casting has the highest quality.",
            "0:08:05.200000": "What we had to do the standard for the gas tank is the quality of the for the casting so we can tell you this but this is a quality in protest.",
            "0:08:18.100000": "That's more chaotic Behavior.",
            "0:08:19.700000": "We have less quality.",
            "0:08:21.200000": "So we had an intrinsic quality assessment.",
            "0:08:24.600000": "So the best candies are like Vietnam countries, which are larger protest a relatively low GDP per capita has been such a thing is to learn from the past basically never occurred in the past.",
            "0:08:53.700000": "Just message you do people copy that gives you a way to look at.",
            "0:08:57.500000": "What is the total outlier.",
            "0:08:59.300000": "So China appears as though you can even think that's never happened in the past because they occupy a very unique Zone in this diagram concerning developed countries.",
            "0:09:14.700000": "This is certainly probably the most difficult question.",
            "0:09:18.200000": "So he's where the girl that doesn't make sense either forget to call five one minor point to buy 678 NW France.",
            "0:09:42.300000": "So UK, we don't get The Strokes you can.",
            "0:09:44.400000": "We got the weak signal for The Grow Show what we have to do we have to resort to use them or they that goes with that we need to use before.",
            "0:09:53.600000": "What did they stop on patterns shown in the mission, then you can be to the space of Technologies and you can locate your country in the space of Technology.",
            "0:10:03.900000": "Then even for this developed countries.",
            "0:10:06.400000": "You can add a new dimension with the technological feat that so you have to go to another dimension of data.",
            "0:10:12.900000": "So we don't throw away the day that we left out before but the first picture is impressionistic picture of the global economy that the ghost from u.s.",
            "0:10:22.500000": "To the poorest countries in Africa from this picture you solve the China mystery, which is what I was quiet place and then you want to know the difference between Italy and France which are pretty similar in this type of global picture.",
            "0:10:37.600000": "Then you have to go into the technological space do the technology and even decide to be with you.",
            "0:10:43.900000": "So you have to put the magnifying glass and the morning formation.",
            "0:10:49": "In terms of prediction.",
            "0:10:50.500000": "However, let me Circle back to advanced economies.",
            "0:10:53.100000": "If I look at your key visual which shows a regression line that shows you where is a country's income expected to be relative to its economic Fitness fair.",
            "0:11:04.900000": "Look at that regression line.",
            "0:11:06.400000": "I see a number of countries above the line to the rides Germany.",
            "0:11:10.600000": "I think I remember South Korea are you predicting that there is downward pressure on these economies or are you even saying there will be negative growth because they're Above the Law of equilibrium line.",
            "0:11:26.900000": "I mean, if you are there more or less you make as much money as you should give you and your fetus with the microscope is it gives you an idea with the rest of Europe and USA?",
            "0:11:44.800000": "What's happening was the China as a rounded?",
            "0:11:49": "Action jobs went to China because I mean by manufacturing.",
            "0:12:03.600000": "So if it is challenging and difficult to stay in the zone if you are able to do it, it means you're very good.",
            "0:12:19.800000": "But you have to be aware that you are competing with the rest of the world and they simply has shown that the older the Western economy went back in with such a big amount of production went up.",
            "0:12:34.900000": "So everything is if you want to be about the red line without ever be something like oil or something, which outfit is completely is it will it Bloom then you have to be aware that you are in the challenge.",
            "0:12:48.900000": "Position this is the way we were systemic and structural change.",
            "0:12:58.200000": "How does economic complexity in your model after that?",
            "0:13:01.300000": "So economies are open complex systems the rules change and balances grow shocks a car but most importantly you have slow-moving glacial speed of structural and in fact, the biggest criticism of Economics, perhaps as a discipline his dad pre-2008 before the global financial crisis, the discipline ignored the financialization of the economy.",
            "0:13:25.600000": "Is it ignore the financial system which however Harbor all at risk?",
            "0:13:29.600000": "So my question is, how does your model deal with the systemic and structural risks that are constantly evolving?",
            "0:13:38.500000": "What your question of Eddie's ecology this is our research project something easier.",
            "0:13:48.700000": "At least let's talk about 2008 crisis.",
            "0:13:52.300000": "What are we witnessing?",
            "0:13:54.500000": "We are witnessing 6% of the real estate capital of USA, which is a lot compared to the war 36% went broke and I would interpretation is a little bit different.",
            "0:14:16.700000": "So this was a shock.",
            "0:14:18.700000": "However this shock trigger another East ability, which is to do with the China that they are all the big fraction of the manufacturing power of the West in USA.",
            "0:14:38.500000": "Really very much less than the global warming effects that the way she do in incident with the coming up of China and India David Global instability to the whole of the West because if you look at China for the checkbook, you look at GDP growth of China.",
            "0:14:59.300000": "You don't see the 2008 crisis.",
            "0:15:02.100000": "If you go to China and you tell it that is the word crisis of 2008 tell you which classes we didn't see it.",
            "0:15:09.800000": "So it is a western prices in the Bible means there was an intrinsic weakness of the western with respect to the rest of the world.",
            "0:15:20.900000": "So it's a little bit more sophisticated but this was one part of your question, but there was another one that was really interesting as I don't remember now, I guess my point would be let's take a concrete example China and you've been precise that economics can play Predictive China's continued growth quote accurately, but would economic complexity capture the financial risks that are also building.",
            "0:15:47.600000": "So you have a credit gross that is unprecedented it sustainable so far, but there are potential scenarios where it becomes unsustainable and when an economy but quickly and middle-income economy is hit by a financial crisis that could throw it back on its development pass for many years.",
            "0:16:06.100000": "He could paralyze it for for many years and definitely so my point is the model as it is focused on economic complexity of sophistication about Cod all that isn't isn't so tied into if I understand correctly these risks that are systemic and nature and predominately rooted in the financial domain.",
            "0:16:26.300000": "Is there any way of capturing that or is it said of the outside of the model?",
            "0:16:30.200000": "I mean it's outside however considered it to make a product you need Finance because you need to So what we don't capture is a change of these parameters, so he's different answer was good.",
            "0:16:45.900000": "Then you'll see that you're doing this is a very nice as a crisis that this will take some time to reflect into products.",
            "0:16:56.100000": "However, that is basically what we do is industrial analysis much Financial.",
            "0:17:03.200000": "However, that is a financier elements into it as well.",
            "0:17:07": "What is that?",
            "0:17:09.600000": "We expect to shocks or dividers for the simple quiet related to resilience so I can say is those Rebel to react to any shocker better than the cancer would love it there and you can see China is an example of that would be one of the few countries which are supposed to be even though This is perfectly aligned with that were established forecasting.",
            "0:17:45": "Have you done work to backtest the model?",
            "0:17:48.500000": "So basically taking a point in the toss a 2000 or 1990 restrict yourselves to the available data at that point in time.",
            "0:17:56.300000": "Look at the predictions.",
            "0:17:58.300000": "Your model would have generated kind of actually at that point in time and compare it to the real last time.",
            "0:18:03.300000": "Is that something you've done we want to do elements because this is the scientific tester for me.",
            "0:18:17.500000": "I mean, are you going to make it in 2005 and we have all the days after 2005 is worth what I asked for the next 5 vs.",

Martin is Professor Emeritus of Strategic Management, at the University of Toronto's Rotman School of Management, where he served as Dean (1998\u20132013) and as Director of the Martin Prosperity Institute (2013\u20132019). In 2017 Thinkers50 named him the world's #1 management thinker. In this podcast with Martin Reeves, Chairman of the BCG Henderson Institute, he discusses insights from his new book, When More is Not Better, which analyzes the growing inequality in American society as a threat to the democratic-capitalism underpinning its historical success. Martin posits that treating the economy as a machine and over-emphasizing efficiency drives this inequal distribution of the spoils of growth. The book advocates the alternative metaphor of the economy as a complex adaptive system that encourages a new set of behaviors from business executives, politicians, educators and citizens\u200a-\u200awhich could sustain democratic capitalism. *** About the BCG Henderson Institute The BCG Henderson Institute is the Boston Consulting Group's think tank, dedicated to exploring and developing valuable new insights from business, technology, economics, and science by embracing the powerful technology of ideas.

            "0:01:12.200000": "And so what the premise of the book is is that we have become so obsessed with efficiency and pushing efficiency.",
            "0:01:18.600000": "We have caused it to create some real negatives for the economy that I think threatened Democratic capitalism.",
            "0:01:26.200000": "And so what we about to do is is step back from this obsessive pursuit of efficiency into something that's more balanced in order to restore the prospects for the future of American Democratic capitalism to be counterintuitive to do some Business Leaders question, one of the foundational concepts of business efficiency, if the role of business is great value for society and one can do that more efficiently.",

            "0:02:04.400000": "But what happens is is if you're going to pursue efficiency, you got to have some measurements for that to know whether you are getting more efficient or or not.",
            "0:02:15.800000": "And what I would argue is that we've adopted proxies for efficiency that make it easier for us to attempt to follow them and those proxies get viewed as efficiency Itself by this process called surrogation.",
            "0:02:31.200000": "They become viewed as efficiency itself pursuit of those proxies as ended up getting results that nobody really wanted and so it started the blind pursuit of efficiency to an extreme using proxies that are imperfect that have gotten this into trouble not the concept of efficiency itself.",
            "0:02:53.300000": "So if I understand you correctly Although you might be doing that to us sizing how we simplistically measure efficiency.",

            "0:03:36.300000": "But if you talk to people about derivatives, they would say I know Rodger they helped make the capital markets more efficient and I'd say what do you mean by efficient and they said well, yeah, they help you narrow the bid-ask spreads on the major stock exchanges and we do that is in some sense a good thing.",

            "0:04:19.200000": "Then I'd say you are obsessively taking a fish and seed to the extreme and using a crummy proxy board and getting outcomes that nobody who said there were doing the efficiency actually wanted but they were oblivious to the obsessiveness and its consequences for lying too much on simple practice.",
            "0:04:47.100000": "And another is too much of a good thing and you kick off the book with is income distribution.",

            "0:05:09.700000": "How does one need to the other it turns out that and this is this comes out of relatively recent work on complexity Theory, which is that if you take a system and let's just say it's a US economy of some kind of a system to take a system and apply ever more pressure to it that addition of pressure can turn what is more of a independent distribution.",
            "0:05:34.800000": "So I go see and bell-shaped normal distribution, which we sort of thought of in the at the economy producing a big bulge we have this is the view that there is a very large middle class and then there are some of us a tale of poor people in a tale of richer people and that's going to be the economic outcomes and hopefully if we run an economy Well, those outcomes will get better over time.",

            "0:07:07.700000": "But efficiency in my view has taken what democratic capitalism needs which is this more normal distribution with a large middle-class.",

        "episode_description": "John Kay is one of Britain\u2019s leading economists, and has been a Fellow of St John\u2019s College, Oxford since 1970. His work is centered on the relationships between economics, finance, and business. Today his main focus is on writing and he is renowned for his ability to express complex ideas clearly and succinctly. He is the author of many books, including The Truth about Markets (2003) and Obliquity (2010). In his new book, Radical Uncertainty: Decision-Making Beyond the Numbers, co-authored with Mervyn King, he argues that models have only limited value in guiding business decision making. In a numerical world, decision making should be guided by developing and critically challenging reference narratives, to figure out \u201cwhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d. In a conversation with Martin Reeves, Chairman of the BCG Henderson Institute, Kay discusses insights from his new book, epidemiology, the accuracy and applicability of models, and what leaders can do to break with prediction addiction. *** About the BCG Henderson Institute The BCG Henderson Institute is the Boston Consulting Group\u2019s think tank, dedicated to exploring and developing valuable new insights from business, technology, economics, and science by embracing the powerful technology of ideas.

            "0:25:41.900000": "Very nice paper by a couple of legal Scholars a few years ago studied exactly this kind of diffusion of responsibility in the context of title 7 law in the United States, which is the body of laws and cases governing anti discrimination in hiring and employment in the United States and this very nice paper basically in a painstaking way goes through and it says like if you look at all of the landmark cases historically for title 7 and you Revisited them changing only one thing which is instead of people or the company having maybe these decisions an owl with the made them could a good defense attorney kind of wig allowed of the decision because of this diffusion of responsibility and their answer was an overwhelming.",

            "0:28:44.700000": "But on the other hand machine learning Ai and albums are incredibly precise artifacts engineered and design by humans and some kind of language has to develop between these two ways of thinking that lets us kind of make progress.",

I think then obviously there are policies that companies are putting into place to make the workforce more flexible for whether it's you know, mothers that needs whatever whatever flexibility people might need that's different from the traditional, you know person that they would employ so I think it's a question of Technologies and processes that need to be put in place the the processes of company is acid like habits.",

        "episode_description": "Loizos Heracleous is Professor of Strategy and Organisation at the Warwick Business School, and Associate Fellow of Green Templeton College and Sa\u00efd Business School. In his new book, Janus Strategy, he argues that organizations can accomplish strategies that seek to reach competing goals. Traditional strategy wisdom suggests that there are two generic strategies\u200a\u2014\u200adifferentiation and cost leadership. It is assumed to be impossible to combine both for a prolonged period of time, and those who try succeed only temporarily (in new markets that aren\u2019t competitive yet) or fail at both. However, some organizations prove that it is possible to be a sustained cost leader whilst being differentiated or to explore while exploiting. Janus Strategy uses case studies to explore the six factors that make this possible. In a conversation with Martin Reeves, Chairman of the BCG Henderson Institute, Heracleous explains the mindset and moves leaders need to make their organization a Janus organization. *** About the BCG Henderson Institute The BCG Henderson Institute is the Boston Consulting Group\u2019s think tank, dedicated to exploring and developing valuable new insights from business, technology, economics, and science by embracing the powerful technology of ideas.

        "episode_description": "Marc Levinson is an independent economist and historian. He is the author of The Box (2006) and several other books, a former finance and economics editor of The Economist, a former senior fellow of the Council on Foreign Relations, and a former sell-side analyst. His work has focused on trade, finance, globalization, and business. In his new book, Outside the Box, he argues that a fourth phase of globalization is underway, which will no longer be defined by cost optimization through shipping physical goods. Instead, the fourth globalization is about the spreading of ideas and services trade. In a conversation with Philipp Carlsson-Szlezak, BCG Chief Economist, he discusses the likely impact of this shift on inequality, inflation, the trade-off between efficiency and resilience, and the U.S.-China decoupling. *** About the BCG Henderson Institute The BCG Henderson Institute is the Boston Consulting Group\u2019s think tank, dedicated to exploring and developing valuable new insights from business, technology, economics, and science by embracing the powerful technology of ideas.

            "0:01:04.200000": "It was the development of the steamship in the Telegraph 1830-1840 and open the way to what I call the first globalization which saw a huge increase in international trade and also an International Investment particular European investors put a lot of money into US steel industry and Argentine railroads and so forth.",

Her six previous books include Willful Blindness, which was named one of the most important business books of the decade by the Financial Times. In this podcast with Martin Reeves, Chairman of the BCG Henderson Institute, she discusses insights from her forthcoming book, Uncharted: How to Navigate the Future. Heffernan argues that the future is inherently unpredictable and, as such, we really need to stop force-fitting models for prediction onto business strategy and elsewhere, as doing so only provides us with a false sense of certainty and security. Instead, she argues, the right approach is to embrace uncertainty and use scenario planning, experimentation, and imagination. She discusses several domains (art, military intelligence, \u201ccathedral\u201d projects like CERN) where acceptance of uncertainty and using creative approaches has led to great success.  *** About the BCG Henderson Institute The BCG Henderson Institute is the Boston Consulting Group's think tank, dedicated to exploring and developing valuable new insights from business, technology, economics, and science by embracing the powerful technology of ideas.

        "episode_description": "In a conversation with Christian Ketels, Chief Economist of the BCG Henderson Institute, Piero Ghezzi, former Minister of Production from Peru says new economic development models are emerging, with a focus on sectoral collaboration across the public and private sector. Governments have much to gain, especially as traditional macro approaches seem to be less and less effective in driving sustainable growth. Firms benefit significantly, too, by facing a business environment that provides them with growing opportunities. Collaboration, however, is more difficult than spending or receiving fiscal incentives. All partners need to be aware that this is a longer (but more sustainable) journey towards higher prosperity and economic performance.",

            "0:01:15.600000": "I think that we can probably think about for trade scenarios.",
            "0:01:20.900000": "The first one is a full fledge a trade war between the US and China and others are the consequences that the rules that have constrained the adoption of all tariffs and other trade policy instruments are basically abandoned and this is a situation where I basically we will see a lot of turmoil in the market and a system where power rather than Market will be at Kenai resources a second scenario is what we could call a grand bargain which is some kind of a managed tree where we could see for instance a China agreeing to buy more agricultural products from the US or more natural resources in exchange for getting some protection for its investments in the US or the possibility of buying restricting export controls on the side of the US the third type of scenario would be the uncertainty continues create friction Go On by you know, the Indy The Weeknd assistant, they undermined the system, but they do not go into a full-fledged a trade war and positive scenario would be that all of this attention lead into a reform of the WTO, which will probably come in as a Reduce been selected multilateralism in the number of areas in order this scenarios.",

            "0:03:58.400000": "Are we in a world where those type of indicators exists?",

            "0:05:18.600000": "So I think that in for you know for the WTO to to survive at we were probably need to look at some kind of arrange a green mint certainly among the key players portfolio for broader number of countries, that would involve a solution to issues like subsidies in strengthening the rules of the WTO in the area.",

            "0:07:04.200000": "I think we should look at this, you know in the sense that while during maybe some short-term opportunity and I'm going to give you example for instance of the Chinese market being closed to the US soybean and then Brazil exporting more soybeans to China that it's a short-term opportunity but in the long-term, I think that no country no country.",
            "0:07:31.900000": "Whence and and the reason for this is because all of the uncertainties that accompanies this different scenarios actually make it very difficult to do to do business.",

            "0:08:56.200000": "It's very difficult for business to actually operate in that in that can assist a message somewhere Market allocate the resources, then then then you have to spend much more time and resources trying to figure out how you're going to position yourself in that in that scenario.",
            "0:09:20.400000": "We talked about the the instruments that trade policy uses.",
            "0:09:24.300000": "A lot of the focus is on the Tariff rates and you know, the two new tires that have been imposed as you negotiate a trade agreements, you know, I'm sure there was a much broader set of issues on the table.",

            "0:09:46": "I think you are very right in saying that there's a lot of discussion around the Tariff today because it has made a comeback when we thought it was almost, you know going to be completely eliminated by Bing Crosby on tariffs.",

            "0:11:05.400000": "So it is broader than the time and I think this is one reason why it wants to be concerned because ultimately firm, you know may be able to deal with a tariff depending on many circumstances.",
            "0:11:20.300000": "Some of this other instruments are much more complex attitude to administer us to understand the impact might be quite differential depending on what type of bears the burden and who's going to gain from a certain certain intervention is being made right system, but that might also be a kind of now under discussion is is how we deal with digital trade and how do we how do we deal with data rules where we stand at the moment and then how important is it to kind of find a global standard?",
