Unfortunately, given the [[Travel]] restrictions, my Chinese bosses wouldn't be allowed to enter the US and I'd possibly be quarantined both on arrival to the US and on my return to [[China]] afterwards.

We're all in this together, after all! But that's balanced with the constant fear that any stranger could be a carrier, which manifests in strange ways. Didi drivers construct ever more elaborate plastic guards to shield themselves from their passengers. My coworkers, local friends, and even my local police officer [5] constantly remind me that the disease is serious and that I should always wear my mask! I even had a moment of fear the other day when I was holding a friend's hand on the subway. What if people got angry at us for making physical contact (without gloves, even!) in public? It was a surreal thought. In all my years of being openly queer I've never feared to hold someone's hand in public (a testament to generational progress and to the lovely places I've lived), but for the first time I felt that worry here, because of the quarantine.",

Based on the number of reported cremations and on reports of possibly more accurate numbers on cases that appeared briefly on Tencent and were suppressed, we have conducted a modeling study to estimate the incidence and other parameters of the outbreak, including the potential starting time. The numbers for [[cumulative cases]], new [[cases per day]], and [[cumulative deaths]] coming from the non-official data are all substantially higher by a factor of 5 to 10 (depending on the date of the data) than would be implied by the official Chinese government data. All sets of non-official data used here imply that the coronavirus outbreak began in October or late September 2019.",

It is not clear whether this could contribute to patient death.\"]][[\"Because steroids suppress the immune system, giving patients methylprednisolone could increase ventilator-associated or healthcare-associated pneumonia (VAP/HAP). In Chinese patients, some patients had drug-resistant VAP or HAP attributable to gram-negative rods (GNR--a subset of bacteria), as well as fungi. These secondary pneumonias increased their mortality rate.\"]][[\"In this physician’s hospital, they have not seen VAP or HAP, even in patients who were on the ventilator for a long time before they examined the airway using bronchoscopy. This could be due to the Seattle physician’s hospital not using steroids. It could also be due to another way that the Seattle folks are working to prevent VAP, although we don’t know for sure.\"]][[\"In Hong Kong, they are doing a trial using hydroxychloroquine (HC), giving it IV every 8 hours.\"] [\"Many of the patients in Seattle have COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) using inhaled corticosteroids (ICS).
