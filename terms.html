                1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or
                suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have
                materially affected his settlement with the debtor.” If you are a resident of another jurisdiction, you
                waive any comparable statute or doctrine.</p>

            <p class="asdf">This Section titled “Dispute resolution by binding arbitration” is referred to in this
                Agreement as the “Arbitration Agreement.” You agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen
                or may arise between you and Hebbia, whether arising out of or relating to this Agreement (including
                any alleged breach thereof), the Site, Software or Services, any advertising or any aspect of the
                relationship or transactions between us, shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding
                arbitration, rather than a court, in accordance with the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, except
                that you may assert individual claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify. Further, this
                Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or
                local agencies, and such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf. You
                agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you and Hebbia are each waiving the right to a trial by
                jury or to participate in a class action. Your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a
                judge or jury. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this
                Arbitration Agreement.</p>

                INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION
                OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND Hebbia AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN

            <p class="asdf">Hebbia is always interested in resolving disputes amicably and efficiently, and most
                customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer’s satisfaction by emailing customer
                support at
                <!-- --> <a class="asdfasdf" href="mailto:support%40hebbia.ai">support@hebbia.ai</a>. If such
                efforts prove unsuccessful, a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by
                certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”). The Notice to Hebbia should be sent to 548
                Market Street, #35410, San Francisco, CA 94104, Attn: Operations Department (“Notice Address”). The
                Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (ii) set forth the specific
                relief sought. If Hebbia and you do not resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after the
                Notice is received, you or Hebbia may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the
                amount of any settlement offer made by Hebbia or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until
                after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Hebbia is entitled.</p>
            <h4 id="arbitration-procedures" class="_277Af4e">d. Arbitration Procedures</h4>
            <p class="asdf">Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the American
                Arbitration Association’s (“AAA”) rules and procedures, including the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for
                Consumer-Related Disputes (collectively, the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.
                For information on the AAA, please visit its website, https://www.adr.org. Information about the AAA
                Rules and fees for consumer disputes can be found at the AAA’s consumer arbitration page,
                https://www.adr.org/consumer_arbitration. If there is any inconsistency between any term of the AAA
                Rules and any term of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms of this Arbitration Agreement
                will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration
                Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow
                the provisions of this Agreement as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide,
                including, but not limited to, issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this
                Arbitration Agreement. Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than
                trials and other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an
                individual basis that a court can award to an individual under this Agreement and applicable law.
                Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very
                limited reasons.</p>
            <p class="asdf">Unless Hebbia and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a
                reasonably convenient location for both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and
                other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination shall
                be made by AAA. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, Hebbia agrees that you may choose whether the
                arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a
                telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds
                $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which
                the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to
                explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.</p>
            <h4 id="costs-of-arbitration" class="_277Af4e">e. Costs of Arbitration</h4>
            <p class="asdf">Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the
                “Arbitration Fees”) will be governed by the AAA Rules, unless otherwise provided in this Arbitration
                Agreement. If the value of the relief sought is $75,000 or less, at your request, Hebbia will pay all
                Arbitration Fees. If the value of relief sought is more than $75,000 and you are able to demonstrate to
                the arbitrator that you are economically unable to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees or if the
                arbitrator otherwise determines for any reason that you should not be required to pay your portion of
                the Arbitration Fees, Hebbia will pay your portion of such fees. In addition, if you demonstrate to
                the arbitrator that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation,
                Hebbia will pay as much of the Arbitration Fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the
                arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. Finally, if the value of the relief sought is $75,000 or less,
                Hebbia will pay reasonable attorneys’ fees should you prevail. Hebbia will not seek attorneys’
                fees from you. But, if you initiate an arbitration in which you seek more than $75,000 in relief, the
                payment of attorneys’ fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.</p>
            <h4 id="confidentiality" class="_277Af4e">f. Confidentiality</h4>
            <p class="asdf">All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision, or award by the
                arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.</p>
            <h4 id="severability" class="_277Af4e">g. Severability</h4>
            <p class="asdf">Without limiting the severability provision in the Section titled “General Provisions”
                of this Agreement, if a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or provision of this Arbitration
                Agreement other than clause (b) of this Arbitration Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, the parties
                agree to replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that
                comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this
                Arbitration Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. If a court decides that any of the provisions
                of clause (b) of this Arbitration Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this
                Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void, unless such provisions are deemed to be invalid or
                unenforceable solely with respect to claims for public injunctive relief. The remainder of this
                Agreement will continue to apply.</p>

            <p class="asdf">The failure of either party to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein
