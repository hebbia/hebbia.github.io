						“personally identifiable information” for monetary consideration to a person for that person to
						license or sell such information to additional persons. “Personally identifiable information”
						includes first and last name, address, email address, phone number, Social Security Number, or
						an identifier that allows a specific person to be contacted either physically or online. We do
						not engage in such activity; however, if you are a Nevada resident who has purchased or leased
						goods or services from us, you may submit a request to opt out of any potential future sales
